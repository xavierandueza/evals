When services are imported into most GST jurisdictions (like Australia, India, Canada), they are subject to GST/HST/IGST at the standard rate.\\n\\nKey considerations:\\n- Freight is classified as a supply of services, not goods\\n- The service is being provided by a foreign supplier (China-based)\\n- Import of services typically triggers GST obligations\\n- The charge would fall under \\\"Transportation services\\\" or \\\"Logistics services\\\"\\n- The GST/HST applies to the service fee itself, regardless of whether the goods being transported are GST-exempt or taxable\\n\\n**Applicable Rate:** Standard GST rate (typically 10% in Australia, 5% in Canada for HST, 18% in India for IGST, etc., depending on jurisdiction)\\n\\n**Confidence Level: 0.92**\\n\\nThe classification is highly standard, though the exact rate and any exemptions may vary by jurisdiction. If this freight is part of an imported supply that qualifies for an exemption, the treatment might differ.\""}}]}
