Financial services, including:\\n- Account maintenance fees\\n- Transaction fees\\n- Account administration charges\\n\\n...are specifically listed as exempt supplies. This exemption applies because financial services are considered essential services that should not be subject to consumption tax.\\n\\n## Confidence Level\\n**0.92**\\n\\n### Caveat\\nThe confidence is high but not absolute (0.92 rather than 1.0) because:\\n- GST treatment can vary by jurisdiction\\n- Some specialized or unusual fee structures might be treated differently\\n- The specific institution and account type could theoretically affect classification in edge cases\\n\\nFor standard banking fees in most jurisdictions with GST/HST systems, this classification is reliable.\""}}]}
