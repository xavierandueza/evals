Specifically:\\n\\n1. **Professional Services Exemption**: Consulting services provided by qualified professionals often qualify for GST exemption\\n2. **No GST Collected**: The provider would not charge GST on this invoice\\n3. **Input Tax Credits Limited**: The provider cannot claim GST credits on related expenses\\n4. **Context**: Without additional details suggesting this is a supply of goods or a taxable service (like event management, recruitment, or IT services), professional consultation defaults to exempt\\n\\n### Important Caveats:\\n\\n- **Jurisdiction-dependent**: GST treatment varies by country and region\\n- **Professional type matters**: Some consultants may be required to register and charge GST\\n- **Small business threshold**: May not apply if below registration threshold\\n- **Service specifics**: If this includes software, tangible goods, or other taxable components, classification could change\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Confidence Level: **0.65**\\n\\nThe confidence is moderate because the classification depends heavily on:\\n- Specific jurisdiction\\n- Nature of consultation (legal, financial, technical, etc.)\\n- Supplier's GST registration status\\n- Whether mixed supplies are involved\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Verify against your local tax authority's guidance for your specific jurisdiction.\""}}]}
