Under GST regulations, exports of services are considered as zero-rated supplies. However, the mode of supply and the treatment under the reverse charge mechanism need to be carefully evaluated. In this case, since the export is to a foreign country, it falls under the 'Exports' category, which is typically taxed under the reverse charge mechanism. Services exported to foreign countries are generally charged with GST under the reverse charge mechanism, meaning the onus is on the importer to pay the GST. Hence, it is classified as GST on Imports.\\\"\\n}\""}}]}
