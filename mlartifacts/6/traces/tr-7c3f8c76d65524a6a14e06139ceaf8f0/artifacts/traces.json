Under the GST Act 1999, certain transactions involving foreign transactions may qualify for the GST-free treatment. Specifically, services provided to an overseas recipient, such as this consulting service, are typically considered GST-free. The reasoning lies in the fact that the service is provided 'outside Australia' since the client is not located within the country, and the supply is not consumed within the Australian territory. Therefore, the $3,500 income from this consulting service qualifies for the GST-free category.\\\"\\n    \\n\\n    \\n\\n    \\n}\""}}]}
