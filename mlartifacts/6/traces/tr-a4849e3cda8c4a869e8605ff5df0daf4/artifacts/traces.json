In India, such interest, when derived from business operations, may fall under the category of services. GST is applicable on the supply of services, which includes transactions related to banking and financial services. Additionally, if the interest is considered a taxable supply, it may fall under GST on Imports if the service is being availed from a foreign vendor or is imported in nature. The 85% confidence level arises from the understanding that while interest on a business account typically isn't taxed under GST, specific circumstances where the interest is part of imported services or taxable supplies could lead to it being classified under GST on Imports.\\\"\\n}\""}}]}
