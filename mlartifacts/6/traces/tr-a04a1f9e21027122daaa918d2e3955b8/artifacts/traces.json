Under Australian GST law, certain services like hosting may qualify for the GST-free threshold if the annual turnover is below the GST registration threshold. However, in this case, the specific supply of website hosting by AWS is not listed in Schedule 1 of the GST Act as an exempt supply. But wait, perhaps I was confusing it with IT services. Alternatively, AWS hosting services might be considered part of the broader IT supplies which may sometimes have different tax treatment depending on the nature. However, upon a closer review, website hosting services are generally considered a taxable supply since they involve providing access to infrastructure, which is akin to supplying a service that is not explicitly exempt. Therefore, the GST would be applicable on these fees. Wait, but some hosting services can be GST-free if they are provided by declared providers, but that's under specific circumstances. Hmm, perhaps the initial understanding was incorrect. Also, it's essential to examine whether AWS is a non-resident supplier, as this might affect the application of the GST. Non-resident suppliers might have different obligations. Yet, there's another perspective: in some cases, cloud computing services can be treated differently, possibly falling under a different category. But given the information, it's more straightforward to assume the GST applies here. However, to be precise, the GST on AWS hosting would be calculated at the standard rate, as it's a taxable supply. Therefore, even though the GST-free threshold could apply to the business as a whole, the specific supply is taxable. The GST amount would be calculated as 10% of $145.5, which is $14.55 GST. Confident in this conclusion, I would rate this at a 0.95 confidence level as the law is clear on such services generally being taxable.\\\"  }\""}}]}
