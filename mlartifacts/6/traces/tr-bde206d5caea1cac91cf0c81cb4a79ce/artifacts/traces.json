Rental income from residential properties is considered a supply of housing accommodation, which falls under the GST exemption for residential dwellings. This exemption applies to:\\n- Rent from residential properties\\n- Long-term housing arrangements\\n- Standard lease agreements for residential use\\n\\nThis is one of the clearest examples of GST-exempt income in property transactions.\\n\\n**Confidence Level:** 0.95\\n\\n---\\n\\n*Note: This assumes a standard residential tenancy in a GST-applicable jurisdiction. If this is commercial property, mixed-use property, or a short-term holiday rental, the GST treatment may differ. Please confirm the property type if you need further clarification.*\""}}]}
