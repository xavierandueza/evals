Under Australian GST law, most basic foods are classified as GST-free supplies (GST Act 1999, Div 38).\\n-   **GST Type:** GST-free.\\n-   **Reasoning:**\\n    -   Item 1 of the GST-free provisions in Division 38 specifically lists \\\"food and beverages for human consumption\\\" as GST-free, with certain exceptions.\\n    -   Basic, unprepared bread and plain milk are explicitly recognised as GST-free items. They are not listed among the exceptions (e.g., prepared meals, restaurant food, certain beverages).\\n    -   The nature of the items and their pricing are consistent with a retail sale of basic groceries, which are standard GST-free supplies.\\n-   **Confidence Score:** 0.99\\n\\n    *(Confidence is very high as the supply of basic bread and milk is a fundamental and clear-cut example of a GST-free item under Australian law.)*\""}}]}
