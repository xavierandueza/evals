Some jurisdictions may have specific conditions (e.g., service must be performed outside the jurisdiction, or client must be a non-resident business).\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Confidence Level: 0.75**\\n\\n*The high confidence reflects the standard treatment of overseas service exports as GST-free. However, the 0.25 uncertainty accounts for:*\\n- *Jurisdiction-specific variations*\\n- *Potential specific exclusions for certain consulting types*\\n- *The need to verify the client's residency status in your jurisdiction*\\n\\n**Recommendation:** Verify with your local tax authority or accountant for jurisdiction-specific requirements.\""}}]}
