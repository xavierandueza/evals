In Australia, most fee-based financial supplies (like account-keeping fees, transaction fees, and service fees) are input-taxed supplies under GST law. This means that the bank does not charge GST on these fees to the account holder. Therefore, for the account holder (the business incurring the fee), the fee is a purchase that has no GST included in the price. It is treated as a GST-free purchase from the business's perspective for GST reporting purposes (i.e., no GST credit can be claimed).\\\"\\n}\""}}]}
