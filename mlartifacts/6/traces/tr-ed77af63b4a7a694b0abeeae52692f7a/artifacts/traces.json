Therefore, GST is not charged on the rent, and the supplier (landlord) cannot claim input tax credits for acquisitions related to making this supply.\\\\n- This applies regardless of the amount of rent received. The residential rent of $2,400.00 is consequently classified as GST-free income for GST reporting purposes.\\\\n- The fundamental principle is that the provision of residential rent is an explicitly input-taxed financial supply.\\\"\\n}\""}}]}
