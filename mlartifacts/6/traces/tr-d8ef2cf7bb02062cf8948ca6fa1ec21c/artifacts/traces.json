The supplier (Google Ads/advertising agency) **cannot claim input tax credits** on expenses related to providing these services\\n3. This applies to media buying, ad placement, and advertising service fees\\n\\nGoogle Ads specifically provides advertising placement services, which fall under the category of marketing/advertising services that are input taxed.\\n\\n## Confidence Level: **0.85**\\n\\n### Caveat:\\nThe confidence is not higher (1.0) because:\\n- The exact GST treatment can depend on the specific nature of the service (e.g., if bundled with other services)\\n- Recent GST changes or specific contract terms might affect classification\\n- If the service includes taxable components beyond pure advertising placement, treatment could differ\\n\\n**For certainty**, you should verify against the ATO guidelines or consult a tax professional for your specific circumstances.\""}}]}
