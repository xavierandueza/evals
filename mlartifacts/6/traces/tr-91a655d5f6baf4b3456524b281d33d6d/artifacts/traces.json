Specifically:\\n\\n1. **Digital products/services** - Software licenses are typically classified as digital or electronic services\\n2. **Exemption status** - Many jurisdictions provide exemptions for:\\n   - Certain digital services\\n   - Information technology services\\n   - Software licensing arrangements (particularly B2B)\\n\\n3. **Domestic supply** - The \\\"domestic\\\" designation confirms this is a local supply (not cross-border), which affects GST treatment\\n\\n4. **Standard practice** - Software licenses sold domestically often qualify for GST exemption or reduced rate depending on jurisdiction-specific rules\\n\\n### Important Caveats:\\n\\n- **Jurisdiction matters**: This could be GST-taxable in some jurisdictions or at a reduced rate\\n- **License type**: The specific nature (SaaS vs. perpetual license) may affect classification\\n- **Customer type**: B2B vs. B2C may have different implications\\n\\n## Confidence Level: **0.65**\\n\\nThe classification as GST-free is reasonable for most common jurisdictions, but this heavily depends on:\\n- Specific country/state GST rules\\n- Exact nature of the software license agreement\\n- Recent regulatory changes\\n\\n**Recommendation:** Verify against your specific jurisdiction's GST guidelines or consult a tax professional.\""}}]}
