A medical consultation falls squarely within this exemption category as it is:\\n- A professional medical service\\n- Provided by a qualified healthcare provider\\n- A core healthcare service (not ancillary goods or administrative fees)\\n\\n**Confidence Level:** 0.92\\n\\n**Note on Confidence:** The 0.08 uncertainty accounts for:\\n- Possible jurisdictional variations in some regions\\n- Potential for this to be a non-medical consultation incorrectly labeled\\n- Some edge cases where certain \\\"consultations\\\" by non-regulated practitioners might be taxable\\n\\nIn standard circumstances, this would be **GST-exempt**.\""}}]}
