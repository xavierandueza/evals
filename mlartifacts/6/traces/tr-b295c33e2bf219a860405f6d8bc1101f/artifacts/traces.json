Under Australian GST law, marketing services are generally considered taxable supplies if the supplier is registered for GST. Google Ads, as a division of Google LLC, is likely to be registered for GST in Australia given its significant presence and business operations. Therefore, this transaction should attract GST. The absence of an explicit GST amount in the description does not negate this, as the price may be GST-inclusive or GST may be applied separately. The nature of the supply (marketing services) is clearly a taxable supply under Division 9 of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999.\\\"\\n,\\n\\\"gst_type\\\": \\\"GST on Income\\\"\\n,\\n\\\"confidence\\\": 0.7\\n}\""}}]}
