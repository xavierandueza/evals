This exemption applies to:\\n- Tuition and course fees for accredited educational institutions\\n- Training courses that provide formal instruction\\n- Most educational services provided by registered educational bodies\\n\\nThe $450 fee for an education course falls squarely within this category and would not be subject to GST, assuming it's from a recognized educational provider.\\n\\n**Confidence Level:** 0.85\\n\\n**Caveat:** The confidence is not higher (1.0) because:\\n- The exemption can vary by jurisdiction\\n- Some specialized courses or non-accredited training may be subject to GST\\n- The status of the educational provider matters (some commercial training companies may not qualify)\\n\\nIf this is for a specific jurisdiction or involves a non-standard educational arrangement, verification would be recommended.\""}}]}
