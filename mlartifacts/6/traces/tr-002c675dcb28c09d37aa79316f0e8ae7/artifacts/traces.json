In GST terms, rent from commercial properties is typically classified under which GST category? Well, the first thing that comes to mind is that commercial rents can be either business or lease category. Considering the nature of the transaction, it's related to a property let out for commercial use, which might be considered as a service or tangible asset. Looking into GST regulations, services are taxed under the 'leasing of immovable property' subcategory, typically falling under the GST code for services. However, if it's a lease of a commercial property for manufacturing or business purposes, it could be eligible for Input Tax Deduction, depending on the utilization of the property. But in this case, since the price is $3200, it's not clear whether the property is used for business operations or for other commercial purposes. There's ambiguity on whether it's an operational lease or a finance lease. Operational leases are considered services and are taxed under GST, while finance leases are treated as sales. Since the exact nature isn't specified, it's hard to definitively assign a GST code. Therefore, I can only assign a confidence level of 0.7 for this classification.\\\"\\n  \\n  }\""}}]}
