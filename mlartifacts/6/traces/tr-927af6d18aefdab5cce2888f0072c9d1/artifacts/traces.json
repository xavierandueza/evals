This is a standard exemption for basic food items in their natural state. The exemption typically applies to:\\n\\n- Unprocessed fruits and vegetables\\n- Items sold in their raw/fresh form\\n- No significant processing or preparation\\n\\nSince the description indicates \\\"fresh\\\" produce with no mention of processing, cooking, or value-added preparation, this clearly falls under the food exemption category.\\n\\n## Confidence Level: **0.95**\\n\\nThe high confidence reflects:\\n- ✓ Clear legislative exemption for fresh produce\\n- ✓ Explicit use of the word \\\"fresh\\\"\\n- ✓ No indication of processing or prepared goods\\n- ⚠️ Minor uncertainty only if there were hidden processing details not mentioned in the description\""}}]}
