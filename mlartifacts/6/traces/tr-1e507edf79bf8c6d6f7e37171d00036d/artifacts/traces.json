Under Australian GST law, imported goods are generally treated as if they are supplied by the importer to themselves. Therefore, the GST is self-assessed on the value of the goods, including any duties or taxes. In this case, the price of $1250.0 represents the total value of the imported goods. Since the GST is to be self-assessed, the transaction is not included in the BAS as a separate line item but is accounted for through the input tax deduction process. This aligns with the rules outlined in Schedule 1 of the GST Act 1999.\\\"\\n}\""}}]}
