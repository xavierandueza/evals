In most countries with GST/VAT systems (including Australia, Canada, and others), these items are classified as **essential groceries and are GST-exempt** or taxed at a zero rate. They are not luxury items and are considered staple foods.\\n\\n## Confidence Level\\n**0.95** (very high confidence)\\n\\n### Note on Confidence Deduction\\nThe 5% reduction is because GST treatment can vary slightly by jurisdiction:\\n- Some regions may have specific rules about fortified bread or flavored milk products\\n- The exact product type (e.g., specialty/artisan bread vs. standard loaf) could theoretically affect classification in edge cases\\n\\nHowever, for standard bread and milk, GST-exemption is nearly universal.\""}}]}
