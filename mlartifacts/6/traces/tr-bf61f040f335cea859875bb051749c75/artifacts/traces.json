This is because:\\n\\n1. **Essential service classification** - Utilities like electricity are typically exempt from GST to avoid cascading tax effects on essential services\\n2. **Input tax credits** - Businesses can typically claim back any GST paid on electricity through their input tax credit system (making the net effect GST-exempt anyway)\\n3. **Standard practice** - Commercial electricity bills typically show $0 GST charged\\n\\n### Important Note:\\nIf your jurisdiction applies GST to electricity (rare), or if this is a residential property rather than a business office, the classification would differ.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Confidence Level: 0.85**\\n\\n*The high confidence reflects that electricity is exempt in most major jurisdictions, but 0.15 uncertainty accounts for potential jurisdiction-specific variations or whether this might be a residential space misclassified as \\\"office.\\\"*\""}}]}
