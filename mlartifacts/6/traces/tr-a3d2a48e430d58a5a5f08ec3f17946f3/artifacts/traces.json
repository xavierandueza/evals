Here is the assignment and reasoning for the transaction:\\n\\n**GST Type:** GST-Free (Medical Services)\\n\\n**Reasoning:**\\nUnder Australian GST law, a supply of a *medical service* is GST-free when it is provided by, or on behalf of, a recognized medical professional (e.g., a doctor, specialist, or other approved health provider) and is generally accepted in the medical profession as being necessary for the appropriate treatment of the recipient.\\n\\nA \\\"medical consultation\\\" directly fits this definition. It is a service provided by a qualified medical practitioner (like a GP or specialist) for the diagnosis, advice, or treatment of a patient. Therefore, it meets the criteria to be classified as a GST-free supply.\\n\\n**Confidence:** 0.98\\n\\n*Note:* The high confidence reflects the clear and standard nature of a medical consultation. The minimal uncertainty (0.02) accounts for extremely rare, niche scenarios where the consultation might not be for a medical condition (e.g., a non-therapeutic cosmetic consultation), but the term \\\"medical consultation\\\" overwhelmingly implies a GST-free service.\""}}]}
