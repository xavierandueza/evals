If you're in a different country, this may differ—some regions tax these services at standard rates.\\n\\n## Confidence Level: **0.75**\\n\\n**Reason for moderate confidence:** While hosting services are typically GST-exempt in major jurisdictions, exemption rules can vary by:\\n- Specific jurisdiction and its tax authority interpretation\\n- Whether the service is B2B or B2C\\n- Specific terms of service and what's included in the hosting package\\n\\n**Recommendation:** Verify with your local tax authority or accountant for your specific jurisdiction's ruling.\""}}]}
