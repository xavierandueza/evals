In Australia, basic business expenses such as electricity, gas, and water are typically GST excluded, meaning the GST is not charged on these supplies. However, if the supplier is required to charge GST for these services, it may be included in the transaction. For an office environment, it's more likely that the GST would be excluded unless the supplier is a business-to-business transaction where GST applies.\\\"\\n}\""}}]}
