Specifically:\\n\\n1. **Financial Services Exemption:** Interest on deposits, loans, and business accounts falls under the exempt supply category for financial institutions\\n2. **Input Tax Credit Implications:** While the interest received is exempt, the business may still be eligible to claim input tax credits on related expenses (depending on jurisdiction rules)\\n3. **No GST Collected:** The bank/financial institution does not charge GST on the interest paid to the account holder\\n4. **No GST Payable:** The business does not owe GST on this interest income\\n\\n### Key Point\\nThis is a passive financial service, not a supply of goods or services subject to GST.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Confidence Level: **0.95**\\n\\n**Note:** Confidence is not 1.0 because GST treatment can vary slightly by jurisdiction. However, the exempt status of interest income is consistent across most major GST/HST regimes.\""}}]}
