Under Australian GST law, exports of goods and services to non-residents are generally GST-free. This means that the seller does not charge GST on the supply, and the buyer is not required to pay GST on the importation in the destination country. Therefore, this transaction should be classified as GST-free expenses.\\\"\\n}\""}}]}
