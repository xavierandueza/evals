Under Australian GST law, services connected with the international transport of goods to Australia are GST-free if the supplier is a non-resident. However, if the supplier is an Australian resident, GST may apply. Without explicit information on the supplier's residency, there is ambiguity. The default assumption, based on the origin being China, is that the supplier is a non-resident, making the supply GST-free. But since this is not explicitly confirmed, there is moderate uncertainty.\\\",\\n\\\"gst_type\\\": \\\"GST Free Income\\\",\\n\\\"confidence\\\": 0.75\\n}\""}}]}
