Under Australian GST law, most business transactions that are not excluded or specially treated are subject to GST. The lease of commercial property falls under the category of 'supply' as defined in the GST Act. Since the supply is of a commercial nature and there is consideration (the rent), GST must be charged on this transaction unless an exemption applies. In this case, there is no indication that any GST exemptions, such as those for residential rental properties or specific business activities, apply. Therefore, the GST type assigned should be 'GST on Income.'\\\"\\n}\""}}]}
