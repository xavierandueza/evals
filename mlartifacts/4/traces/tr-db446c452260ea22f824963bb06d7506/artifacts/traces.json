In Australia, for example, most education courses provided by registered providers are GST-free, but this is not universally true everywhere and depends on the specific nature of the course and provider. However, the question does not specify the jurisdiction or provider type. Given that the transaction is for 'education course fees' and no exemption is explicitly stated, the default assumption for a business transaction is that it is a taxable supply. Therefore, GST (Output) should be applied. If this were in a context like Australia with GST-free education, it would be input-taxed or GST-free, but without that specific context, the standard practice for a sale of services is to treat it as a taxable supply.\\\"\\n}\""}}]}
