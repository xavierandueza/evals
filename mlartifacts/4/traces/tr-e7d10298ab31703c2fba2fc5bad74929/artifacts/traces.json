Typically, electronic goods like laptops are subject to GST upon importation or domestic purchase. Assuming this is a domestic transaction within a GST-implemented country (like Australia, Canada, etc.), it would fall under GST on goods. Since no specific context indicates it is an overseas import, but the category is goods, we classify it as GST_ON_IMPORT (which in many systems refers to GST on goods, including domestic purchases).\\\"\\n}\""}}]}
