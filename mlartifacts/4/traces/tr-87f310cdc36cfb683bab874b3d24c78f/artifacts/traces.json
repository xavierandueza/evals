However, the price is listed as '$387.45' without explicitly stating that GST is included. Since the description doesn't mention GST and the amount appears to be a round figure, it is most appropriate to treat this as a BASEXCLUDED transaction, meaning the amount of $387.45 is the total including GST, and the GST component needs to be calculated (1/11th of the total). This is standard practice for Australian business expenses where the total amount is shown without a separate GST line item.\\\"\\n}\""}}]}
