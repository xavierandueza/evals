However, for consulting income to be GST-free for an Australian supplier, the recipient of the service must be outside Australia, and the service must be effectively used or enjoyed outside Australia. Since the transaction is for consulting income from an overseas client, and assuming the overseas client is outside Australia and the consultancy is effectively used outside Australia, the transaction qualifies for GST-free treatment.\\\"\\n}\""}}]}
