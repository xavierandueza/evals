Since no additional context is provided, such as the nature of the consultation, the default assumption is that it may be a GST-free professional service. If this consultation were not GST-free (e.g., standard business consulting not exempt), it would typically be classified as 'GST on Income'; however, absent specific details indicating a taxable supply, GST Free Income is the appropriate category.\\\"\\n}\""}}]}
