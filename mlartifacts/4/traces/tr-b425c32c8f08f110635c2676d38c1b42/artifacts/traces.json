Since software licenses are considered a supply of goods (tangible personal property) and the sale is domestic, GST would apply. The term 'domestic' likely implies a transaction within the same country, but without explicit mention of the buyer being a consumer (B2C) or business (B2B), we consider the nature of the product. Software licenses are often sold to businesses for commercial use, and the amount ($1800) suggests a B2B transaction rather than a typical consumer purchase. Therefore, it is classified as B2B for GST purposes.\\\"\\n}\""}}]}
