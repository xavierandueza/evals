Google Ads is an online advertising service, and the provision of such services is typically considered a taxable event. Therefore, the GSTR-6G should be applicable here. However, considering the exact nature of the transaction and the taxability under the current GST framework, the service might fall under 'Professional fee' and be charged under the applicable GST rate. Given the price is $890.00, which is a standard amount for marketing services, it reinforces the classification under professional services taxable under GST.\\\"\\n}\""}}]}
